## Introduction
The key feature of Elderwood Expedition is its customizable combo system. In most games, one button usually corresponds to one ability or a series of predetermined moved; however, in this game, abilities (called runes) are like items that can be placed into timeline-like slots, where each click of the button will activate one tune, going from top to bottom.
